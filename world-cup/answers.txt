Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

with a small number of simulations is faster

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the perdictions stabilized after about 100000 simulations
